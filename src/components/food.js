                I absolutely love cooking yummy food, mostly asian cuisine (cantonese, chinese, japanese, korean etc.) but I try to branch out and make foods from other cultures as well. In a way,
                I see each meal I make as a mini project where I design the recipe first to optimize the yummy-ness while minimizing effort, then fabricating 
                it into the final meal (ignoring the consequent "manufacturing" process inside my body that indiscriminately turns all foods into a similar final product)
                </p>
