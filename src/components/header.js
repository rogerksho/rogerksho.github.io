              <p className="intro">I am a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, where I
              majored in Mechanical Engineering and minored in Computer Science. My passions and interests revolve around all things precision, including precision machine design, 
              levitators/tweezers, precise manipulators, and just about any shiny metallic thing that is highly precise and/or accurate. In general, I like to work on technologies that 
              that have societally relevant, immediate, practical applications.

              I currently work full-time as a Design Engineer at a stealth-mode robotics startup. During my time at the university, I mainly worked on the design and testing of a flexure-based high-performance (large range, high speed, high precision and accuracy)
              nanopositioning system (HIPERNAP) under Professor <a href="https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/shorya-awtar/">Shorya Awtar</a> at the <a href="https://psdl.engin.umich.edu/">
