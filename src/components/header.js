              <p className="intro">I am a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, 
              majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science. My passions and interests include precision machine design, 
              levitation/tweezers of all kinds (electromagnetic, optical, acoustic), and yummy food. In general, I like to build systems that 
              accomplish what a human cannot, i.e. move precisely and accurately, or suspend/levitate things in the air (jedi and sith don't count)
              </p>
              <p className="intro">
              I currently develop affordable robotic surgical devices at a stealth-mode startup
              as mechatronics lead. During my time at the university, I worked on the design and testing of a flexure-based high performance (large range, high speed, high precision and accuracy)
              nanopositioning system (HIPERNAP) under Professor <a href="https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/shorya-awtar/">Shorya Awtar</a> at the <a href="https://psdl.engin.umich.edu/">
              Precision Systems Design Laboratory</a> at the University of Michigan.
